# Why is Deep Learning working now
1. More data (digitization) being generated in all fields.
1. Larger network benefits with more data and performs better than smaller network with same amount of data. So as we have more and more data, we can venture to try larger and more complex DL systems thus improving the performance.
1. triple factor: data, compute and interest from researchers.



# Learning from an Internet revolution
1. Shopping mall + website $\neq$ Internet company
    - Internet company
        - A/B testing
        - short shipping times means larger products shipping and faster learning
        - decision making is done by technical people rather than CEO/Owner
 
1. Traditional company + Neural network $\neq$ AI company
    - strategic data acquisition 
    - Unified data warehouses
    - pervasive automation opportunities
    -
